# MindLink

## 1. Model Description

We introduce MindLink, a new family of large language models developed by **Kunlun Inc**. Built on **Mistral**, this experimental model incorporates our latest advances in post-training techniques. The model shows promising results across several common benchmarks and may be useful for various AI applications. We welcome feedback as we continue to refine our approach.


üöÄ What's Next: 

- **Enhanced Models**: More powerful versions are in development and launching soon.
- **Technical Documentation**: Detailed architecture specifications, training methodologies, and benchmark results will be available soon.

Stay tuned as we advance the frontier of language AI.


## 2. API Access

This experimental model can be accessed via our API for those interested in exploration and testing. To obtain your API key, simply drop us an email at __mindlink@kunlun-inc.com__ mentioning **your affiliation** and **intended use case**.


Once approved, you will receive an **API Key**, which enables access to our hosted inference service.

### üîß Usage Instructions

Our Chat API supports OpenAI's format. Simply use your API Key with HTTP POST requests.

#### ‚úÖ Sample Request using `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.mindlink.kunlun-inc.com/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "model": "MindLink_Beta",
           "messages": [
             {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}
           ],
           "temperature": 0.7,
           "max_tokens": 128,
           "stream": false
         }'
```

#### üêç Sample Request using Python:

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
API_URL = "https://api.mindlink.kunlun-inc.com/v1/chat/completions"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

payload = {
    "model": "MindLink_Beta",
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of China?"}
    ],
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "stream": False
}

response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)

if response.status_code == 200:
    reply = response.json()
    print("MindLink Response:")
    print(reply["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
else:
    print(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
```
